DApp is an application build over a decentralised peer to peer network similar to a blockchain platform such as Ethereum. It carries all the benefits which are intrinsic to the Blockchain e.g. decentralised data and processing, peer-to-peer network, immutability, open-source, security and transparency. It is used for development of applications for various domains e.g. financial, game, social and media. It has gained a reputation for its reliability and stability because of its architecture. In this paper, we have surveyed its architecture and security vulnerabilities for released DApps across the application stack including web and smart contracts for several domains.
